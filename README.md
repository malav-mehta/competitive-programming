# Contests

This repository contains the solutions that I've written for problem from different online judges, including:

- [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/profile/malavmehta): malavmehta
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/mmeht1): mmeht1
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/malav-mehta/): malav-mehta
- [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/qbit/): qbit
- [CCCGrader](https://cccgrader.com/): N/A

The solutions are written in C++ (or, occasionally—depending on the problem type—, in Python).

The aim for this repository is to record progress and practice for programming contests. Each solution has been written with the goal of being optimal and simple.
